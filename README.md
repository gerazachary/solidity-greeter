# Solidity sample
A first implementation with solidity language, implemented with truffle and developed through Test Driven Development.

It provides a simple contract to greet and set a greeting, allowed only to the contract owner. This control is added via openzeppelin package, providing `Ownable` module for access mechanisms.

### Test
```
truffle test
```
